In this exercise, you will construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition by using Medical Masks Dataset. The original dataset comes from Eden Social Welfare Foundation which contains the pictures of people wearing medical masks along with the labels containing their descriptions. There are 682 images with over 3000 faces wearing masks and around 700 masks worn either wrongly or not worn at all.
